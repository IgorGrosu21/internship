Execute with: `python main.py`

Algorithm complexity:
- best case (every word is an anagram): O(n)
- mid case: O(n * sqrt(n))
- worst case (all words are different): O(n^2)

In case of increased number of words I would use multitasking or threading to shorten execution time

I tried to write code as readable and explicit as possible, though provided comments in class and methods should be enough
